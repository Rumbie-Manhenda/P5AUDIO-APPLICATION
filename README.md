This application is a web-based audio tool created with p5.js and its accompanying library, p5.sound. It is designed to manipulate pre-recorded sound files,
transmitting the modified audio signal to the computer's speakers or audio output. Additionally, users have the option to capture the altered audio signal and save it as a
digital audio file on their computer. The application offers a range of effects, including a low-pass filter, waveshaper distortion, dynamic compressor, reverb, and master volume,
all interconnected in a sequential chain.
